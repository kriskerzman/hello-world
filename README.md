hello-world
===========

Just testing out creating repos. I've barely even written any code, so.

Yeah. So really, I'm just getting started with coding and would like to browse other people's code as I'm learning. Thus the Github account.

A bit about me. I'm a guy at a place who does a thing. I like crisp session beers and long board games.
